Twitter:
1. Is there an EPA Twitter username that should be used for the via field?

Facebook:
1. Is there already a Facebook App for the EPA? Should a new one be created?
2. Facebook allows for a picture. What do you want?


FROM PATRICK:
1) Need the header
2) Numbers getting clipped
3) Blue color pallet to match current website
4) Smaller footer
5) Odd grey box


FROM CLIENT:
* Seems whitewashed. Would like to get some definition, perhaps a
border. Perhaps buttons get some tint to indicate they are buttons.
* Try reducing header and footer heights in order to get some more
space for the main content.
* Change title to a more simplified "By recycling..."
* Outline the exact phrasing of social text for Twitter and Facebook.
* Somehow make the slider more obvious it is affecting product quantity.
* On share page, area to get JavaScript to embed on another page.
* Investigate changing links externally (perhaps from the JS snippet)
* Make sure that the slide respond to the keyboard or have an input field to make it compliant with the disabilities act.
