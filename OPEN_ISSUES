Twitter:
1. Is there an EPA Twitter username that should be used for the via field?

Facebook:
1. Is there already a Facebook App for the EPA? Should a new one be created?
2. Facebook allows for a picture. What do you want?


FROM PATRICK:
1) x Need the header
2) x Numbers getting clipped
3) x Blue color pallet to match current website
4) x Smaller footer
5) x Odd grey box


FROM CLIENT:
* x Seems whitewashed. Would like to get some definition, perhaps a
border. Perhaps buttons get some tint to indicate they are buttons.
* x Try reducing header and footer heights in order to get some more
space for the main content.
* x Change title to a more simplified "By recycling..."
* Outline the exact phrasing of social text for Twitter and Facebook.
* x Somehow make the slider more obvious it is affecting product quantity.
* On share page, area to get JavaScript to embed on another page.
* Investigate changing links externally (perhaps from the JS snippet)
* x Make sure that the slide respond to the keyboard or have an input field to make it compliant with the disabilities act.

NEW ISSUES:

* Widget looks good in Chrome, looks funky in IE.

* Change Heading of widget to "How much energy can you save by
recycling?" Colored icons of electricity/recycling should be added.
Expand heading area as deemed necessary.

* Change "choose appliance" to "power an appliance"

* In initial screen, the appliance column should be faded out and can't
be selected, so people won't make the mistake of choosing an appliance
to recycle.

* Air conditioner icon is a fan; change icon to look something like
this:  (Embedded image moved to file: pic16099.gif)

* x Add blue arrow and "Slide the button or use your arrow keys to change
the number of recyclables" under sliding button bar.

* x Calculations should round to the nearest 10th; so 1.21 hours should be
1.2 hours.

* Facebook sharing does not work.

* x Shared text for both Twitter and Facebook should read "By recycling 10
aluminum cans, I saved enough energy to power an air conditioner for
1.7 hours. Calculate here: http://1.usa.gov/mS5mrg"
Bolded text should change depending on what appliance and how much of
what is recycled (10 and 1.7).

* Final JS

* x The Learn More link should take people to www.epa.gov/iwarm ; right now
the link doesn't work.
